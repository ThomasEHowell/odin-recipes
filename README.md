This is my first HTML project. It's meant to be a simple website with a few images and use of the HTML basics. It's completion has cemented within me:

-Adding images (including with alternate text and custom size)
-Adding hyperlinks between pages
-Adding lists: ordered & unordered
-Getting a feel for what's possible within just HTML and not CSS & JS
