        <p>Getting your protein in might be tough for you, but it doesn't need to be!
            Introducing our protein shake. A nice healthy shake that you can make in just five to ten minutes
            which will satisfy much of your daily protein needs without needing too many calories. What's more is we didn't use
            any amount of artificial whey protein powder in our recipe so as to save ourselves from
            their <em>terrible</em> energy crashes. We hope you enjoy.
